// 1```````````` Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.

let carName = "Volvo" ; 


// 2``````````On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:

// So What Will Be The 1st Variable Name, Then 2nd Variable Values & 
// 3rd Variable Name And Values Both! 

let firstName = "John";  // write variable name
let lastNamet = "Doe" //write variable values 
let age = 35 ; // write variable name and values both 




// 3``````````````` Use the correct assignment operator that will 
// result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y). 

x = 10;
y = 5;
x *= y // what will be the value of x ?  




// 4```````````````Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:

let length = 16; // number 
let lastName = "Johnson"; // string 

const objj = {
  firstName: "John",  
  lastName: "Doe"
};    // object

 function myFunction() {

myFunction()

const cars = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];
alert('the number of items in an array: ' + cars.length);


// 2. Change the first item of Brand to "Ford".

	const Brand = ["Volvo", "Jeep", "Mercedes"];

// 1. Use the correct Math method to create a random number.
let x = Math.random(1,10);

// 2. Use the correct Math method to return the largest number of 10 and 20.
let  y = Math.max(10, 20);

// 1. Choose the correct comparison operator to alert true, when x is greater than y.

// 2. Choose the correct conditional (ternary) operator to alert "Too young" if age is less than 18, otherwise alert "Old enough".
// let  age = ...;  /**Your value here */
